## 🚀 About Me

I design and build **scalable backend systems** that handle real traffic, real users, and real business complexity.

With deep expertise in **Laravel & PHP ecosystems**, I specialize in:

* High-performance APIs
* Scalable SaaS architectures
* Multi-tenant systems
* Clean Architecture & DDD
* Production-grade backend foundations

I don’t just write code —
I design systems that grow.
